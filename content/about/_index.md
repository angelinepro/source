![Me][1]

I'm a data scientist with a background in many things health (public health, healthcare, mental health, not necessarily in that order). My work can't always be public, especially when it pertains to health data collected with personal identifiers, datasets and code containing privileged information. If you are interested in write-ups of that work, please see the publications in the sidebar. This site is for the work that can be public: personal projects and questions I've wanted to dig into. 

#### highlights:

I gave a talk at PyGotham 2020 on how I built the Album Discoverer, a tool to discover albums in today's track and playlist-obsessed world. Slides are on Github, and video is [here][2]. There's also a blog post.

I presented at useR! 2019 in Toulouse, France, on my blog posts on fantasy baseball. You can find slides on GitHub (see the icon in the sidebar), as well as [video here][3] starting at 9:26. 

I built a mental health syndromic surveillance system that signals when there are changes in emergency department visit patterns for suicidal behavior visits, and presented on it at the New York State Suicide Prevention Conference [here][4]. 

I've written about mental health emergency department utilization in New York City, looking at primary diagnosis and patient demographics for those discharged to the community [here][5].

I’ve also written about what suicide deaths look like in New York City, how that has changed since 2000, and how these deaths are different from suicide deaths in the rest of the United States [here][6], [here][7], and [here][8].

I also love to teach! I've developed and given corporate trainings to internal stakeholders to improve data literacy and utilization. I’ve taught R programming to ~150 analysts working for the NYC Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, explaining the nuts and bolts of R programming, demonstrating how to conduct exploratory data analysis, teaching data visualization and functional programming. I’ve also assisted teaching first-year graduate students about categorical data analysis, SAS programming, and quantitative foundations of biostatistics and epidemiology.

#### education:
- MPH in Epidemiology, Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health 
- BS in Genetics and Plant Biology, University of California, Berkeley

#### things I love:
1. [Turtles][9]
2. SF Giants baseball
3. Food (airplane and otherwise)
4. Mushrooms
